But I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man and I will never forget him.</p>

                 <p>As I heard this sad news via my iphone, I am emailing my condolences from my Macbook Pro. Steve has left a fingerprint on our culture that cannot be rivaled and will be long lasting. My deepest sympathy to his family and friends.</p>

                 <h3><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></h3>
                 <p>What impact has Steve Jobs had in my life? Every short story I've written as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every email I've ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realise the Star Trek Future I dreamed of as a kid.And through his vision I have been able to realise my own. You will be missed Mr Jobs. Thanks for your amazing work.</p>

                 <p>Dear Apple, I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Steve Jobs, the great leader and creator in the world. I believe he would go to a more beautiful place and he would like to see a stronger Apple. We will remember him forever. </p>
